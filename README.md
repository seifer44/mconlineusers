# mconlineusers
Output users online your Minecraft user to a modifiable output.

Simply run this script in a screen and Control+C when you're done.

As it's currently configured, the output will go to a .js file and output as a javascript variable. This is modifiable. I have marked the parts of the script that should be changed to modify the output to another format. This includes the delimination of the users online.
